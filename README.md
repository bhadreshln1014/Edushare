# **EduShare - Educational Resource Sharing Platform**

EduShare is a platform that enables educators to share, discover, and collaborate on educational resources. The platform facilitates the exchange of teaching materials while building a community of education professionals.

## **Features**
* Resource Management: Upload, categorize, and share educational resources
* User Profiles: Customizable profiles showing uploaded resources and activity
* Rating System: Give and receive feedback on educational materials
* Download Tracking: Monitor resource popularity and usage
* Educator Network: Connect with other educators through friend requests
* Privacy Controls: Choose whether your profile and resources are public or private

## **Tech Stack**
* Frontend
   * Next.js: React framework for server-rendered applications
   * Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework
   * Lucide React: Icon library
   * ShadCN UI Components: Modern component library
* Backend
   * Django: Python web framework
   * Django REST Framework: Toolkit for building Web APIs
   * PostgreSQL: Relational database

## **Deployment**
* Frontend: Deployed on Vercel
* Backend: Deployed on Render
* Database: PostgreSQL on Render

## **Learning Outcomes**
Throughout the development of EduShare, I gained valuable experience in:
* Designing and implementing RESTful APIs with Django REST Framework
* Building responsive, modern UIs with Next.js and Tailwind CSS
* Managing user authentication and permission systems
* Implementing relational database design for complex data relationships
* Creating a complete full-stack application with separate frontend and backend deployments
* Developing social features like friend requests and privacy controls
* Handling file uploads and downloads securely

## **Challenges Overcome**
During development, I successfully addressed several challenges:
* Creating an intuitive user interface that accommodates both content creators and consumers
* Implementing a secure authentication system with token-based authorization
* Managing complex relationships between users, resources, ratings, and downloads
* Designing an effective rating system that provides meaningful feedback for resource creators
* Building a responsive UI that works well on both desktop and mobile devices
* Deploying the application across separate services while maintaining seamless integration

## **Future Enhancements**
Future iterations of EduShare could include:
* Resource collaboration features allowing multiple educators to work on materials together
* Notification system for new ratings, downloads, and friend requests
* Analytics dashboard showing resource usage statistics
* Integration with popular learning management systems
* Mobile application for on-the-go access to educational resources
* AI-powered recommendation system for suggesting relevant resources

## **Local Development**
Local development setup is currently not available as the codebase is optimized for production deployment. A development branch with local setup instructions is planned for future release. If you're interested in contributing to this project, please reach out!
